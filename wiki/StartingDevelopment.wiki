#summary Getting started with development of gclient.

= Initial checkout = 

`gclient` uses itself to fetch the [http://code.google.com/p/pymox/ mox] object-mocking modules, which it uses in its unit tests.  Here's how you get started:

== For committers ==
Since trunk/ already contains a .gclient file, you can reuse it directly:
{{{
  $ svn co https://gclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk gclient-dev
  $ cd gclient-dev
  $ python gclient/gclient.py update
}}}

== For non-committers ==
The default .gclient file uses https. So it's better to just ignore it. The following steps are for users without gclient on their system:
{{{
  $ mkdir gclient-dev
  $ cd gclient-dev
  $ svn co http://gclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gclient
  $ python gclient/gclient.py config http://gclient.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gclient
  $ python gclient/gclient.py update
}}}

= Running the unit tests =

The unit tests are all in the `gclient_test.py` script, which you just feed to `python`:

{{{
  $ python gclient_test.py
}}}

The unit tests should also work fine when executed from other directories.

= Code reviews =
Use `gcl.py`. It is available from [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools depot_tools] which happens to also include `gclient.py`. Use `gcl.py help` for more information or email gclient@googlegroups.com if you are really stuck.
